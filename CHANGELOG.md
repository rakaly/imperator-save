## v0.3.1 - 2022-07-08

- Empty IMPERATOR_TOKENS is same as unset

## v0.3.0 - 2022-07-02

- Saves can be converted into JSON
- One can deserialize and melt a save without parsing the save again
- Saves can be deserialized into arbitrary structures
- Using binary tokens from `IMPERATOR_TOKENS` is no longer implicit
  and must use `EnvTokens`
- The inflated size of a save is exposed instead of hard capping it at
  200 MB
- Parsing via a `Read + Seek` (and an anonymous memory mapped file as
  storage for inflated contents) has been dropped in favor of parsing
  directly from a byte slice.
